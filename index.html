            <p>My name is Martha Skalak.  I have a undergrad degree in Computer Science and a Masters in Cell & Molecular Biology.  
            After a career in financial transaction software development, I am now spending time on passion projects.     
            My non-computer hobbies include growing Cymbidiums, constructing and doing crossword puzzles, reading novels, and hiking.

            <p>I am attending this class because it is a core part of the CSM Web & Mobile Application Development Certificate that I'm 
            working towards.  This certificate program provides a good structure for covering topics important in 
            full stack development. 
            I hope to create native and/or web apps with engaging graphics that users can interact with to understand complex biological ideas.
